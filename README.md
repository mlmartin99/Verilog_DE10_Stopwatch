# Verilog_DE10_Stopwatch

As a final lab project for Digital Project, a digital stopwatch was developed using Verilog 
Hardware Description Language and the DE-10 standard board. The stopwatch needed to be able 
to keep track of time intervals to a precision of a tenth of a second, keep track of time for up to 
9:59:59:9 in an H:MM:SS:T format, have functions to start, stop, and reset the clock, and be able 
to hold the five most recent times in its memory. Our stopwatch keeps track of time in an 
H:MM:SS:T format, where T displays the each tenth of a second. The stopwatch makes use of 
switches to start and stop the timer and a pushbutton to reset the board. Switches are also used to 
access the five most recent times from memory. The stopwatch performs all functions as 
intended.
